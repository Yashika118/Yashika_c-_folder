// Heaps/priority Queue
// heaps is a complete binary tree
// complete binary tree means: max capacity of containing no. of nodes at each level and
//    last level can be fully filled or partially filled .
// we can filled the last partially filled level of tree--> from left to right only.

// Heaps are of two types
// 1. max heap--> at every node , parent ka data > lst and rst
//  by default heap is max heap
// 2. min heap--> at every node , parent ka data < lst and rst
// time complexity of heap --> O(1)
